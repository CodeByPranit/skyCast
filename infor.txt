
1. **HTML** – Structure for the app:

   * A header with app title and search bar.
   * A section to display the current weather, temperature, location, and details like wind, humidity, etc.
   * A 5-day forecast grid.
   * A map placeholder section.

2. **CSS** – Styling for premium look:

   * Uses variables (`--primary-color`, `--accent-color`) for easy theme control.
   * Gradient background and glassmorphism effect using `backdrop-filter`.
   * Animations for icons like sun rotation, clouds floating, and raindrops.
   * Responsive design using media queries for mobile screens.

3. **JavaScript** – Functionality:

   * **Theme toggle** button switches between dark and light modes.
   * **Weather API fetch**: Calls `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json` to get weather details for 5 days.
   * **Dynamic UI update**: Updates temperature, weather conditions, icons, and forecast based on the API data.
   * **Search functionality**: User can type a city and press search or enter to get updated weather data.
   * Helper functions like `formatDate()` and `updateWeatherIcon()` for displaying data cleanly.

How to Make It Simple?

To simplify:

* **Remove animations and extra styles** (only basic colors and font).
* **Skip the forecast section** and show only current weather.
* **Remove theme toggle** (keep a single theme).
* **Show only essential details** like temperature, city name, and weather condition.
* **Keep only one fetch API call** for current weather, not 5-day forecast.
